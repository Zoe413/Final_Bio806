My project will be about determinging the chill requirement of 'Geneva 3' kiwiberries, and using plant growth hormones to delay kiwiberry budbreak in the spring. 

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
